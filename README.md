# cmsc131-description
Due to the University of Maryland's academic policies, I cannot make my projects for CMSC131 (Object Oriented Programming I) public.
Thus, I have described my work for these projects below.
If you are an employer, I can share my private code repository with you. Just email me at tanner.george@outlook.com
